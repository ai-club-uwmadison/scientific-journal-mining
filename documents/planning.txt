Project Planning Outline

Brainstorming Notes: the project should be able to output an outline on a search topic in a standard format (perhaps Wiki friendly, like an automated book report or comprehensive curated review article) to include: when a scientific fact was first discovered, and the paper(s) that discovered it if possible, this is important to back link research on a topic that was not "discovered yet" but was observed or studied previously, yielding useful data that could contribute to a topic, reducing file draw bias; its "local" impact factor in how the concept/term (including older equivalent terms) was included in science literature after its discovery with subcategories (i.e. number of papers it has been used in, to research it directly (a defined category), papers using it as or in a method (another category)), also statistics related to activity either heat map or histogram on temporal activity to identify lulls in research; Controversy on a topic, like retracted papers, active debate, settled science with a confidence % (gravity ~99% to climate change = apocalypse ~1%); Reference frame of the search topic (field in science of classical hierarchy, universe/domain of discourse, concept effects extensible (is this a fundamental law of physics applicable to most of the known universe, or does it exist in the context of biology on earth during a certain epoch of time or extend to all possible life? (or only known carbon based life, etc.)); reproducible factor (metric for it the study was replicated and confirmed positively or negatively by other studies);
